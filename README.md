Coming soon...
# Building
subparser can be build with [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
A standalone [bash script](./scripts/build.sh) is provided for building, which just invokes CMake with simpler configuration. You can also build it the normal way:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
